ITVPlayer
=========

## Description

ITVPlayer is a simple JavaScript application that loads a single page with an input box. As the user starts entering text in the box the app does queries against the mercury.itv.com api to retrieve the results for the search terms and display them in a list. This sample application aims to demonstrate some modern web development concepts:

- HTML5, JavaScript, CSS
- Demonstrable understanding of OOP concepts, separations of concerns, design patterns
- Maintainable/Testable code, TDD/BDD
- Appropriate use of frameworks and bespoke code
- Package/Dependency management

## Important note

This project has dependency on node (npm) and bower. To start, please install nodeJS (http://nodejs.org/download) and execute the following commands on a terminal/cmd prompt: **npm install -g grunt-cli bower**, and then in the project directory: **npm install && bower install**. This should download and install all the necessary dependencies into the project directory. Please note, these commands only need to be executed once.

## Usage

After the initial setup (explained above), a local dev server serving on http://localhost:9000 can then be started with the command **grunt serve**. A browser window should automatically open with the app running. If it doesn't, just point your browser to the above url and you're good to go.

To run the tests associated with the project, just run the command **grunt test**.

## Technical Description

ITVPlayer is be coded mostly using HTML5/Javascript/CSS3 using a set of tools/libraries described below:
* **Yeoman** : Generates the structure of the project
* **Bower** : A dependency management too for web apps
* **Grunt** : Builds/runs/tests the project
* **Backbone** : Javscript MVC Framework
* **Underscore** : Templating/utility engine for Backbone
* **jQuery** : A utility library used by many

## Improvements

* Add some more tests for validating the collection/model
* Do some DOM testing with phantomJS
* If project expands, might consider moving to a more composite application architecture
* Test the grunt build scripts to build a package for deployment on the live server
* Separate the templates from the index
* Set up continuous integration (e.g. with Jenkins)
